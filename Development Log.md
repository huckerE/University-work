Development Log 

 




One of the many problems I faced was the pickup key mechanic as I could end up picking up the key from all the way on the opposite side of the map. 

  

I ended up fixing this because I ended up doing a check for whenever I ended up pressing "E" that it would check that I was in the radius of the Keys box Collider. 

  

Another problem I kept running into was the fact that when I was doing the door animation it would keep going in a completely unusual way and would keep spinning every time, I would play the animation.  

  

A problem I had was the fact that all my animations were looping at the same time. I did some research on it and found that within the animation there was a button that allowed me to stop the animation from looping all the time called "Loop Time" and I found that it was turned on. 

  

a problem I had run into was that when I had done the chest mechanic, whenever I had to press "G" multiple times for the lid of the chest to open 

 

Another problem that I faced was that it was adding the respawn mechanic and even though the code was right it still was not making me respawn. 

 

I ended up finding out the problem which was me having to go into “project settings” under “physics” I had to turn on “auto sync transforms”
